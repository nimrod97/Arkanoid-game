# Arkanoid game
The implementation of the "Arkanoid" game in java language based on object oriented programming. This project is related to the OOP course that I took in Bar Ilan University.

The files that run the game are being attached. The game has 4 levels that become harder gradually. If you want to pause the game press 'p' and if you want to continue press 'space'
